# Data Structures Algorithms in C++
## Sequential/Linear and Binary Search
Best Time Complexity: **O(1)**, **O(1)** 

Worst Time Complexity: **O(n)**, **O(log n)**

## Enqueue and Dequeue in Circular Queue
Best Time Complexity: **O(1)**

Worst Time Complexity: **O(1)** 

## Queue using 2 Stacks (by making deQueue() costly)
Push method Time Complexity: **O(1)**

Pop method Time Complexity: **O(n)** 


## Graph using Adjacency Matrix
Space Complexity: **V<sup>2</sup>**


## Graph using Linked List
Space Complexity: **V+E** 
> V = no. of Vertices,   E = no. of Edges
